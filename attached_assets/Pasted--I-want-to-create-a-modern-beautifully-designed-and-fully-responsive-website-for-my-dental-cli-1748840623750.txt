I want to create a modern, beautifully designed, and fully responsive website for my dental clinic, using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no backend or database is required.
The website will present detailed information about our clinic, doctors, services, and include photos, contact options, and social media links.

✅ Key Requirements:
Technology:
Use only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Keep HTML and CSS in separate files
Clean code and mobile-friendly layout
No backend or database needed (purely static website)
Content & Structure:
A beautiful landing/homepage with eye-catching design
Display our clinic logo, banner image, and introductory text
A section to showcase two main doctors with:
Names:
 Habibur Rahman Chowdhury
 Tahmid Habib
Their photos and degrees (styled in a clean and professional layout)
Communication & Contact:
A floating message icon fixed on the screen (bottom-right or bottom-left)
When clicked, it will show WhatsApp and Messenger logos
These will link directly to our clinic’s WhatsApp and Messenger chat pages
A section or icons with social media links (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
Design:
Must be very attractive, with modern fonts, colors, and layout
Include multiple images related to Dental for visual engagement
Website must be visually impressive on both desktop and mobile devices
Upon visiting, users should be immediately drawn in by the professional and appealing design
Editing & Hosting:
I should be able to edit the HTML content easily (like updating text or images)
The website must run directly from a mobile device, using apps like Acode or KSWEB
The website will be hosted on GitHub Pages, so keep all files light and simple to manage

📁 Suggested Folder Structure:
/dental-clinic
├── index.html         ← Main HTML file (easy to edit content)
├── style.css          ← All styles and layout design
├── script.js          ← Optional for messaging icon toggle
├── assets/
│   ├── logo.png       ← Clinic logo
│   ├── doctor1.jpg    ←  Habibur’s photo
│   ├── doctor2.jpg    ←  Tahmid’s photo
│   └── other-images/  ← Optional dental images for visual design


💬 Floating Messaging Icon (Functionality Idea):
A button fixed at the bottom corner
On click, shows two options:
WhatsApp icon → opens WhatsApp chat link
Messenger icon → opens Facebook Messenger chat link

🌐 Social Media Section:
Icons that link to clinic’s Facebook, Instagram, or YouTube profiles
Clean layout with hover effects and proper spacing

🚫 Not Required:
No appointment booking form
No database or backend system
